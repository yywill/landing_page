    title='什么是"Trustless Enterprise"'
    description="
    Trustless Enterprise将会是一个完全构建在比特币之上的经济模型实体，这将会是我整篇文章的背景，也是我注册域名的由来。

    而，构建在比特币上的去中心化、免信任的实体，才会在大乱世生存；这也将是大乱世时代唯一的企业活动形式。
    我在这里我否定了传统意义上的：股份制公司、跨国企业，乃至于国家之间直接的法币贸易的形式的可能。
    黄金，在这里会起到一个前比特币的作用（参考俄乌战争时期俄罗斯和中国对于黄金的囤积吧）。
    我在这里，格外强调黄金作为货币的贸易，隐含的意义是：黄金的保存、运输、交换和验真都是一门技术。
    而以上这些则是，黄金这个实物商品作为货币的的全流程。

    请您花几分钟时间思考：比特币作为电子黄金它如果要成为货币，它的保存、运输、交换和验真分别是什么具体行为？
    如果你作为贸易的参与方参与一次比特币作为媒介的贸易活动，你自己的技术薄弱点是什么？

    举例：在金本位时代，如果你是富豪公子，但是你连起码的黄金吹弹验真技术都不懂？你会不会被周围所有人耻笑？
    你的富豪父亲还敢不敢让你继承家产？

    黄金货币几乎在每一个环节都有死穴，而比特币几乎解决了所有问题。比如说：验真是比特币完全解决的一个货币难点。电子货币的运输的成本也远胜与黄金。
    至于交换，在闪电网络的加持下，NFC碰一碰支付或QR二维码支付使得货币的交换无比简单。

    所以不难发现：比特币时代的薄弱环节在于保存。即，如何自我保管比特币？

    这些是我写下本篇网页的核心思想：教会普通人做好比特币储蓄！

    Trustless Enterprise refers to a new business model and organizational form that is built entirely on the Bitcoin network. 
    It embodies the trend of decentralization and eliminating trust.
    It uses only non-custodial cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for all transactions and operations, 
    without involving any fiat money or third-party payment systems. 
    This removes dependence on any centralized institutions. 
    It leverages the decentralization of Bitcoin blockchain to verify transactions without relying on any centralized entities. 
    This allows it to function without trust. It is built on top of the Bitcoin network, r
    elying on its security, auditability and transparency. 
    This obviates the need for centralized auditing or regulation. 
    Its governance structure and operating mechanism emulate the decentralization of Bitcoin blockchain. 
    This enables it to coordinate and operate in a decentralized manner. 
    It considers Bitcoin as the cornerstone of its operation and value storage. 
    This allows it to operate autonomously in a free market without government control.

      description="The claims made by The Wall Street Journal are truly bewildering. The collapse of FTX was clearly due to insider trading and misappropriation of customer funds by its founder, yet it was downplayed by the elite media as the 'shattering of ideals,' which seems more like an excuse to absolve greed-driven behavior. Meanwhile, the concept of 'Not your key, not your coins' becomes particularly important. Only when we truly control our own private keys can we ensure the security of digital assets. If we entrust our funds to third-party custody, our wealth can vanish into thin air in the event of fraud or bankruptcy—this is the reality shown to us by the FTX case.

      When 'ideals' are merely a smokescreen, and when third-party institutions cannot truly be accountable for our interests, we must safeguard our wealth ourselves; this is a fundamental survival rule in this digital age. 
      As reflected in The Wall Street Journal's report, in this game of power and profit, the interests of ordinary people are never the primary concern. 'Not your key, not your coins' is not just a slogan; it is the only way to protect our property. Only through decentralized investment and storage can we effectively control our assets and avoid becoming victims of this power game once again. 
      This is also the original intention behind the birth of blockchain technology—to give everyone true financial autonomy. If we fail to learn from the lessons of history, history will only continue to repeat itself."

      title="Do not trust, verify."
      description="
      At Trustless Enterprise, we firmly believe that trust should be built on verification. This is the principle of 'don't trust, verify' and the cornerstone of blockchain technology upon which Bitcoin relies. This principle emphasizes the importance of decentralization, transparency, and self-verification in financial transactions. 
      By using distributed ledgers and cryptographic protocols to verify transactions and ensure their accuracy, we can avoid relying on intermediaries that may conflict with our interests. Through this approach, we can establish trust based on verification and create a financial system resistant to censorship, fraud, and corruption. 
      
      The Byzantine Generals' Problem describes such a scenario. In this game, Byzantine generals verify each other's loyalty by giving random commands to their hired soldiers instead of making empty promises. 
      Only when the majority of the army follows the same command, the commands become effective. This ensures that no single general can manipulate the entire army. 
      It is a classic solution based on verification, not trust, to balance power. So, if you want to ensure transparency, security, and financial freedom, remember to verify rather than trust. 
      As the Byzantine Generals' Problem illustrates, power should be established on verification and checks, not solely on trust. Only by establishing self-verification and balancing mechanisms through technologies like blockchain can we build a true 'trustless' enterprise that resists excessive concentration and abuse of power.

      description="
      Gosbank (Russian: Госбанк, Государственный банк СССР, Gosudarstvenny bank SSSR - State Bank of the USSR) was the central bank of the Soviet Union and the only nationwide bank from 1922 to 1991. 
      
      Gosbank was one of the three economic authorities in the Soviet Union, alongside 'Gosplan' (State Planning Committee) and 'Gossnab' (State Materials and Technical Supply Committee). 
      
      Gosbank worked closely with the Soviet Ministry of Finance in formulating the national budget.

      In fact, we don't need to imagine CBDC because we have witnessed it in history—the Soviet Union's Gosbank was the most successful CBDC implementation case. However, as we know, it ultimately turned out to be a disaster.

Gosbank had absolute control over the Soviet Union's financial and economic system, governing aspects such as currency issuance, fund circulation, interest rate policies, and account management. This aligns with the powers granted to central banks with CBDC. 
And Gosbank took full advantage of this power—imposing strict regulations on commercial banks and the market, distorting interest rates and exchange rates, conducting comprehensive surveillance of citizens' assets, ultimately leading to economic turmoil and social upheaval."
